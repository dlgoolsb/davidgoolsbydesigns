        <h1>Where Music Meets Comedy...</h1>
        <p>Jokez N Jamz was started in July of 2017 in Greensboro, North Carolina by rapper, Antion Scales, and comedian, David Goolsby. The two launched the concept as a showcase that highlighted both musical and comedic talent from all over the state. A few months later, Roger Gore II, better known as DJ Gito, joined the team on a quest for a creative uprising in the area. They began to regularly host the event at Artist Bloc in Greensboro as a monthly show.

        In August of 2018, Jokez N Jamz hosted its biggest event as a part of Welcome Week at North Carolina A&amp;T State University in Corbett Sports Center. After the show, the trio separated for an unspecified hiatus to further their individual careers and to this day still remain close friends. </p>
